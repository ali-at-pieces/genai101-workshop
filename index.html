            "Despite their size and strength, crocodiles are surprisingly fast swimmers, reaching speeds of up to 20 miles per hour.",
            "Crocodiles have a special transparent eyelid called a nictitating membrane that protects their eyes underwater.",
            "Crocodiles can live up to 70 years in the wild, with some species known to live even longer.",
            "Crocodiles are cold-blooded reptiles, meaning they rely on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature.",

            "Crocodiles have a unique way of communicating with each other through vocalizations, body postures, and even vibrations in the water.",
